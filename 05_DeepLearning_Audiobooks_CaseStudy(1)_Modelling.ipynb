    " For this analysis, data from an Audiobook App are provided. Note that it relates to the audio versions of books ONLY. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once. Based on the available data, I created a machine learning (ML) algorithm that can predict whether customers will re-purchase products from the Audiobook company. <br><br>\n",
    "From the company's perspective, if a customer has a low probability of re-purchasing, the company can reduce costs on advertising to the customer, so that the company can focus its efforts only on the customers who are likely to convert again. In addition, the ML model can identify the most important metrics for a customer who come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities. <br><br>\n",
    "The given dataset contains following information. \n",
    ">- **Customer ID**\n",
    ">- **Book length overall**: Sum of the minute length of all purchases\n",

    ">- **Price Paid avg**: Average paid price of all purchases\n",
    ">- **Review**: A binary variable whether the customer left a review\n",
    ">- **Review out of 10**: A review score that the customer left  \n",
    ">- **Total minutes listened**: Total minutes of time is a measure of engagement.\n",
    ">- **Completion**: The percentage of completion of the audiobook. \"Total minutes listened\" is divided by \"Book length overall\". It is ranged from 0 to 1.\n",
    ">- **Support requests**: Total number of support requests such as forgotten password, assistance for using the App, and so on.\n",
    ">- **Last visited - purchase date**: It is also a measure of engagement. The bigger the difference, the gibber the engagement (in days).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I used all the features as the inputs, except for **Customer ID**, since it is completely arbitrary. \n",
    "The targets are a binary variable, indicating 0 or 1. I took a period of 2 years in the inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. \n",

    "So, basically, I predict whether a customer will convert in the next 6 months. based on the last 2 years of purchasing patterns and individual engagement. 6 months could be debatable, but it is also reasonable. If customers do not convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or didn't like the Audiobooks way of digesting information.  \n",
